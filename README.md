# Introduction to Table Relations in SQL

The majority of databases you'll work with as a developer will have more than
one table, and those tables will be connected together in various ways to form
table relationships.

In this section we'll cover:

- The structure of a relational database as tables
- Primary key and foreign keys
- How to associate data tables using a foreign key column
- How to model **one-to-many** and **many-to-many** relationships
- How a join table is used
- Different types of joins

Over the next several lessons, we'll discuss having multiple tables in a
database, how to define relationships between different tables, and explain the
different types of table relationships that can exist.
